    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>Welcome! My name is Ali Jawad, and if you dont know me, im a speedcuber who is from pakistan, and I hold several national records.
        I currently main Square 1, Megaminx, 3x3 One Handed, and 4x4. I have taught a few people, and my goal is to grow the cubing community further, 
        by making an open-resource that can help people who may be beginners, or advanced solvers. Eventually, this website will be full of tutorials, 
        algoritms, and techniques for cubers of all levels. If you need help with any step or want to help with the development of this website, please DM me on discord, at Techcubes_. 
        <b>This website was based on <a href="https://sarah.cubing.net/">Sarahs Cubing Site</a>. Please go visit her page.</b>
