    <h1>The Clock Page</h1>
    <p>In this part of my website, we will discuss the fundementals of clock, how to improve, the different skill subsets, and more. Ive been practicing
        clock for over a year, and average arounnd 5-6 seconds. I use 7 simul flip, and used to main the method ten moves memoless. Back then, i was a large 
    10 moves memoless fan, and tried to spread it far and wide. it kind of worked, as i taught a big youtuber how to do it, and he made a video gaining over
10,000 views. This allowed clock to be spread further, as it was relatively easy to learn. </p>
