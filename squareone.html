     <h1>The Square-1 Page</h1>
     <p>In this part of my website, we will discuss the fundementals of square 1, how to improve, the ifferent skill subsets, and more. Ive been practicing
          square-1 for over a year, and average arounnd 10 seconds. I can three look some cases, and my personal best is 3.774 seconds. I personally use a method
          where i can identify the CO case during CS, which allows me to atleast do a 4 look. i also can predict the CP case during EO, which means if i can 
          predict both of these, i can essentially three look. while the most common sort of three look is doing CS, CO+EO, and CP+EP, i prefer this way, as its less algs 
     and more intuitiveness. For those who are just stating to learn square-1, check out <a href="beginnersq1.html">Beginner Sq1</a> for the tutorial. I would suggest 
     using samuel fangs tutorial, linked: <a href="">Cube Masters Square 1 Tutorial</a></p>
