     <p>We all know cubeshape is one of the key steps to master for becoming faster. There is beginners, where
        you do scallop/scallop, intermediate, where you do scallop/kite aswell, advanced, where you can do every case
        optimally, and CSP, where you trace and solve parity and cubeshape optimally. In this section of the website
        i will show you how to do beginners to CSP, and hopefully get you to have a good grasp at cubeshape.
